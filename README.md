# Postfix-Evaluation-for-Single-Digit-Integer-
This Repository contains a C code which evaluates a user input postfix expression.
*## Limitation: It can only evaluate the expression only for single digit positive integers. As the input is taken as a string so it can't detect multi digit or any negative number or any float type number.
